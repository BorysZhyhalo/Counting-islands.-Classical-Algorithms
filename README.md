1.Depth-First Search (DFS) Approach
Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
The algorithm starts at the root (or an arbitrary node in the case of a graph) 
and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Main Points:
Traversal Method: DFS explores a node and then recursively visits each unvisited neighbor before backtracking.
Implementation: It can be implemented using a stack (either via recursion, which uses the call stack, or an explicit stack).
Applications: Useful for solving puzzles, pathfinding in mazes, topological sorting, and checking for cycles in graphs.



2.Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
It starts at the root (or an arbitrary node in the case of a graph) and explores the neighbor nodes at the present 
depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Main Points:
Traversal Method: BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
Implementation: It uses a queue to keep track of nodes to be explored next.
Applications: Useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, 
level-order traversal of trees, and finding connected components.


Key Difference Between Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Traversal Strategy:

Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. 
It uses a stack (either via recursion or an explicit stack data structure) to keep track of the path.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all neighbors at the current depth level before moving on to the next level. 
It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored.
Use Cases:

DFS:
Suitable for scenarios where you want to visit every node or path, such as solving mazes.
Useful for tasks like topological sorting, detecting cycles in graphs, and solving puzzles with only one solution path 
(e.g., Sudoku).

BFS:
Ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
Useful for level-order traversal in trees, finding the shortest path in networking, and peer-to-peer applications.
Space Complexity:

DFS: Can be more memory-efficient for wide graphs but can also be more memory-intensive if the graph/tree is very deep.
BFS: Can use more memory, as it needs to store all nodes at the current level, which can be large in wide graphs.
